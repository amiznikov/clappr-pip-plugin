# Usage
Add both Clappr and the pip plugin scripts to your HTML:

```html
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.clappr.io/latest/clappr.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clappr-pip-plugin@latest/dist/clappr-pip-plugin.js"></script>
</head>
```

You can also find the project on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/clappr-pip-plugin

Then just add `ClapprPIPPlugin` into the list of plugins of your player instance.

```javascript
var player = new Clappr.Player({
  source: "http://your.video/here.mp4",
  plugins: [ClapprPIPPlugin]
});
```
That's it, a button will be shown on the media control to enable picture in picture on devices which support it.
